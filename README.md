# SAP Legacy Migration Demo

> **Devin AI** migrating custom ABAP objects to modern Python services.
> All company names, data, and identifiers in this demo are fictional.

## What This Demo Shows

A mid-size retailer ("Acme Retail Corp") has **hundreds of custom SAP objects** accumulated over 15+ years. This demo walks through three representative migrations — the same patterns Devin executes at scale across an entire custom object inventory.

Each example includes:
1. The **original ABAP source code** (realistic, production-style)
2. The **migrated Python service** (FastAPI-ready, fully typed)
3. **Unit tests** proving functional equivalence
4. **Inline migration comments** mapping Python back to ABAP for traceability

## The Three Migrations

### 1. Inventory Report — ALV Report → FastAPI + JSON

| | ABAP (Before) | Python (After) |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `Z_INVENTORY_REPORT` | `inventory_report/service.py` |
| **Pattern** | Selection screen → SELECT → calculate → ALV grid | Query params → SQL → compute → JSON response |
| **Tables** | MARA, MAKT, MARC, MARD, MSEG, MKPF | Data warehouse equivalent |
| **Key logic** | Traffic-light stock status (red/yellow/green) based on reorder point thresholds and stale receipt detection | Identical thresholds, same status enum |
| **Lines** | ~210 ABAP | ~160 Python |

**What Devin did**: Translated the selection screen to `InventoryFilters` (Pydantic model), replicated the traffic-light calculation with identical thresholds (stock ≤ 0 → red, stock < reorder → red, stock < 1.5× reorder → yellow, else green), and replaced ALV grid output with a structured JSON response that includes an aggregated summary the original report didn't have.

### 2. Vendor Lookup — RFC Function Module → REST API

| | ABAP (Before) | Python (After) |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `Z_RFC_VENDOR_LOOKUP` | `vendor_lookup/service.py` |
| **Pattern** | RFC import/export → SELECT → aggregate → return | Request/response → query → compute → JSON |
| **Tables** | LFA1, LFB1, ADR6, EKKO, EKPO | Data warehouse equivalent |
| **Key logic** | Vendor master + PO history with date filtering, quantity limiting, and value aggregation | Same logic, same sort order |
| **Lines** | ~175 ABAP | ~120 Python |

**What Devin did**: Mapped the RFC IMPORTING/EXPORTING interface to a request/response model pair, converted AUTHORITY-CHECK to a typed exception (auth middleware in production), preserved the PO date filtering and `UP TO n ROWS` limit as Python sort + slice, and kept the same aggregate calculation (total PO value, open PO count).

### 3. Order Sync — IDoc Processing → Event-Driven Service

| | ABAP (Before) | Python (After) |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `Z_IDOC_ORDER_SYNC` | `order_sync/service.py` |
| **Pattern** | IDoc segments → parse → validate → BAPI call → status | JSON message → deserialize → validate → API call → result |
| **Tables** | EDIDC, EDIDD, VBAK/VBAP (via BAPI) | Message queue + target system API |
| **Key logic** | Segment-by-segment IDoc parsing (E1EDK01, E1EDK03, E1EDKA1, E1EDP01, E1EDP19), BAPI mapping, commit/rollback | Same parsing logic via structured deserialization, same validation rules |
| **Lines** | ~310 ABAP | ~210 Python |

**What Devin did**: Replaced IDoc segment parsing (`CASE lv_segment / WHEN 'E1EDK01'`) with structured JSON deserialization into Pydantic models, translated BAPI_SALESORDER_CREATEFROMDAT2 parameter mapping to a target system API call, preserved the same validation rules (missing sold-to → error, no items → error), and mapped IDoc status records (51=error, 53=success) to `OrderSyncResult` objects.

## Running the Tests

```bash
cd sap-migration-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

Expected output: **25+ tests passing**, covering:
- Stock status calculation (all threshold boundaries)
- Stock percentage computation
- Status filtering (critical/warning/healthy checkboxes)
- Full report generation end-to-end
- Vendor lookup with PO aggregation
- PO date filtering and result limiting
- Vendor-not-found error handling
- IDoc segment parsing (all 5 segment types)
- Order validation (6 validation rules)
- Single order processing (success + failure)
- Batch processing with mixed results

## The Migration Playbook

See [`migration-playbook.md`](migration-playbook.md) for the reusable playbook that drives these migrations. It includes:

- **Pre-migration checklist** — what to gather before starting
- **Step-by-step migration process** — analyze → design → model → implement → test → validate
- **Pattern templates** — ALV Report, RFC Function, IDoc Processing
- **ABAP → Python translation reference** — common constructs mapped
- **Quality checklist** — definition of "done" for each migrated object

See [`migration-checklist.md`](migration-checklist.md) for the same playbook condensed into a per-object, phase-by-phase checkbox checklist.

This playbook is what Devin executes at scale. Define it once, run it across hundreds of objects in parallel.

## Key Takeaways for Prospects

### What Devin handles (the 80%)
- Translating ABAP business logic to Python, Java, TypeScript, or C#
- Creating typed data models from ABAP structure definitions
- Writing functional equivalence tests for every migrated object
- Mapping SAP interfaces (RFC, IDoc, BAPI) to modern equivalents (REST, events)
- Executing the same pattern across hundreds of objects in parallel

### What consultants handle (the 20%)
- Defining the target architecture
- Creating migration patterns/playbooks
- Migrating SAP configuration (IMG, pricing, workflows)
- Reviewing complex business logic that requires domain expertise
- Integration testing against SAP sandbox environments

### The economics
- SAP consultants: $200–300/hour for repetitive translation work
- Devin: parallelizes that translation across the full object inventory
- Typical efficiency gain: **6–12× over manual engineering**

## Presenter Notes

**Opening** (2 min): "Your SAP system has hundreds of custom objects — Z-programs, RFCs, IDocs. Each one needs to be migrated. That's a huge amount of repetitive translation work. Here's how Devin handles it."

**Walkthrough** (5 min): Open the three ABAP files side-by-side with their Python equivalents. Point out:
- The ABAP type definitions → Pydantic models (type safety preserved)
- The business logic → Python functions (same thresholds, same flow)
- The inline comments → traceability back to original code
- The tests → proving functional equivalence

**Scale story** (2 min): "These three objects took Devin about 15 minutes each. Your SAP system might have 500 of these. Devin runs them in parallel. Instead of a team of 10 consultants working for 6 months, you get the bulk translation done in weeks."

**Honest limitations** (1 min): "Devin doesn't replace your SAP consultants — it handles the translation labor so they can focus on the 20% that actually needs domain expertise: architecture decisions, configuration migration, and complex business process design."
